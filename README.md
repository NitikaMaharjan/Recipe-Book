# Recipebook – A Social Media Platform for Sharing Recipes

## Abstract

**Recipebook** is a web-based social media platform designed exclusively for food enthusiasts to share and explore recipes, and interact with the community. Users can post recipes using a structured template and engage through likes, comments, and bookmarks. The system also includes advanced search functionality, allowing users to find recipes by title, username, hashtags, or category.

Developed using the **Waterfall model**, the platform integrates **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** on the front end, and **PHP with MySQL** on the back end. While the project is complete, there is room for future improvements.

## Problem Statement

- **Lack of a Dedicated Food Community**      
    General social media platforms make it difficult for food lovers to find recipes and connect.

- **No Recipe Templates**      
    Existing platforms don’t support structured recipe formatting, leading to cluttered posts.

- **Limited Recipe Search Tools**      
    Users cannot filter recipes based on title, tags, or ingredients.

- **Minimal Interaction on Food Websites**      
    Traditional recipe websites lack interactive features like likes, comments, and bookmarks.

## Objectives

To build a web application where users can:

- Share recipes using a pre-designed template  
- Search for recipes using recipe title, username, hashtags, or categories  
- Interact with each other through likes, comments, and bookmarks

## Scope

- **Structured Recipe Posting**    
    Recipes are added via a clean and organized form layout.

- **Advanced Search Feature**    
    Users can filter recipes by recipe title, username, hashtags, or categories.

- **Community Engagement**    
    Users can like, comment on, and bookmark favorite recipes.

## Limitations

- **No Real User Feedback**    
    All accounts and activity are simulated; no real user testing was conducted.

- **Not Deployed Online**    
    The platform is not hosted, so scalability and performance are untested.

- **Missing Features**    
    Real-time notifications, multiple images per post, and ingredient-based searches are not implemented.
